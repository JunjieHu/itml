This is the C++ implementation of ITML by Junjie Hu (jjhu@cse.cuhk.edu.hk).

To use this C++ version, you need to install the C++ boost library, which is very popular in std C++ users.
You can install it from its website. http://www.boost.org/

After the instalation, we can paste all the files on the Linux. It is tested on the Ubuntu 12.04.
The result is exactly the same as the Matlab version, but much faster. 
Run the demo:
1. cmake .
2. make
3. ./demo

Then you will find the result in the ./dataset folder. 
Please refer to the implementation detail by ImplementationDetail.pdf and the folder ./html/.
